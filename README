Budgeting Application README
Created by: Team 5 - Randall Woodall, John Ossorgin, Ryan Maez, Juwaria Adil, Hang Ngo


Welcome to our trunk!

In our trunk you will find four folders:
-Budget
-Diagrams
-docs
-tests

And one single build file:
-build.xml

-------------------------------------Running the application--------------------------------------------

There is also one build.xml file, which is used to run our program. If you would like to directly
run our program, open up the terminal, make sure you are in the trunk directory and type:

ant run

This command will compile all of our source code files and run the program. After running the program
our programs main GUI will be displayed and you are free to use our program.


----------------------------------------------Folders---------------------------------------------------
Budget:

Budget is the package folder and contains our source code. If you wish to modify our application on your
own, import this folder into an IDE such as Eclipse. The program can be run through an IDE through the
GuiMain.java program. Simply make sure that GuiMain.java is the currently selected file, and select the 
run option. In most IDEs this will compile and run our program.

If you wish to edit the files in something other than an IDE, select the folder named 'src'. You will
find two folders, 'budget' and 'budget_tests'. 

'budget' contains the main source code for our program.
You can open these .java files in any editor you prefer, the build.xml file should still compile and 
run everyhting. Be carfeul, if you change the directory, or add a new file, you must update the build 
file accordingly. 

'budget_tests' contains all of our JUnit tests, these were run exclusively in Eclipse, our build file
does not run any tests.

The remaining folders in the Budget folder are generated by Eclipse and should not be modified unless
you are a very experienced user.

Diagrams:

The Diagrams folder contains diagrams for our architecture and problem domain model. They were created 
in Dia.

There is a folder 'implementation' that has UML class diagrams for all the classes used in our 
application. These were also all made in Dia.

All of these diagrams are displayed on our Canvas webpage as well

docs:

The docs folder contains a powerpoint presentation we gave to explain our architecture.

tests:

The test folder was used for storing save files and CSV files used for import while we were testing

It currently contains two save files that should not be readable, and one CSV file with a small
list of transactions.
